# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our primary goal was to assist Louise with her crowdfunding campaign to raise more than $10,000 for her forthcoming play "Fever," and to help her make informed decisions for a successful campaign using Excel and the Kickstarter dataset to analyze similar past events and their outcomes, as well as identifying relevant factors that influenced them, enabling Louise to assess different options and strategies to achieve her goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on my analysis of the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart, it appears that summer months, specifically May to July, offer the greatest potential for success due to people's increased willingness to engage in activities during warmer weather; however, the chart also reveals that there are external factors beyond the season that impact success rates, as evidenced by a significant number of failed events during these months. Conversely, December had the highest percentage of failed events, suggesting that it may not be an ideal time to schedule a play due to people's inclination to spend time at home during the colder months.

When visualizing the entire campaign Louise has held, May and June had the most successful campaign. July had the most failed campaigns and the most canceled. In addition to this, Louise ran the most campaigns in July. In addition to this, goals between $1,500 to $1,999 had the same number of success to failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When looking at the outcome based on goals, the projects with goals less than five thousand dollars had a higher percent of success in comparison to those that had a higher goal. However, there were no canceled projects. The goal with an outcome of $1,000 to $4,999 had the most projects completed and were the second most successful.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges that I encountered mainly was figuring out Excel formulas but thankfully I had notes available to go back and review. In addition to this, I found GitBash a little difficult but my tutor was able to answer all of my questions.

## Results

One conclusion I can draw from the Outcomes based on Launch date is that May and June were the most successful campaigns. In addition to this, December had the worst success to failed campaign rate.
After analyzing the outcomes based on goals, I believe that $4,999 is the maximum amount that should be spent on a campaign.
A limitation on this dataset is that the Outcomes based on Goals doesn’t allow the information to be filtered by parent category. If this were to occur, this will allow a more in-depth review of each category. In addition to this, the dataset could be filtered by year to identify if there’s any room for adjustments to be made.
I think we could create another Outcomes by Launch Date graph to visually see all the parent categories together. I would also create another Outcomes based on Goals graph for each parent category. These will allow a more detailed synopsis about the campaigns.
