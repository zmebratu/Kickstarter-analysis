# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was done to compare other campaigns based on the funding goals and the launch dates. The theater campaign was more successful with May and June launch dates. In addition to this, the more successful goals were under five thousand dollars.

### Purpose
After analyzing the play Fever, the purpose of this project was to analyze campaign funding goals and their launch dates to identify trends.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The theater campaigns were most successful when their launch dates were in May and June. However, May had the most failed campaigns while November had the least number of failed campaigns. January had the most canceled campaigns and July had the least number of canceled campaigns.

When visualizing the entire campaign Louise has held, May and June had the most successful campaign. July had the most failed campaigns and the most canceled. In addition to this, Louise ran the most campaigns in July. In addition to this, goals between $1,500 to $1,999 had the same number of success to failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When looking at the outcome based on goals, the projects with goals less than five thousand dollars had a higher percent of success in comparison to those that had a higher goal. However, there were no canceled projects. The goal with an outcome of $1,000 to $4,999 had the most projects completed and were the second most successful.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges that I encountered mainly was figuring out Excel formulas but thankfully I had notes available to go back and review. In addition to this, I found GitBash a little difficult but my tutor was able to answer all of my questions.

## Results

One conclusion I can draw from the Outcomes based on Launch date is that May and June were the most successful campaigns. In addition to this, December had the worst success to failed campaign rate.
After analyzing the outcomes based on goals, I believe that $4,999 is the maximum amount that should be spent on a campaign.
A limitation on this dataset is that the Outcomes based on Goals doesn’t allow the information to be filtered by parent category. If this were to occur, this will allow a more in-depth review of each category. In addition to this, the dataset could be filtered by year to identify if there’s any room for adjustments to be made.
We could create another Outcomes by Launch Date graph to visually see all the parent category. I would also create another Outcomes based on Goals graph for each parent category.
